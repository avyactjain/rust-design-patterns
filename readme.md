# Rust Design Patterns Playground ðŸš€  

A collection of Rust design pattern implementations as I learn and explore best practices in Rust. This repository includes examples of **creational, structural, and behavioral** patterns, with explanations and code samples.  

## ðŸ“‚ What's Inside?  
âœ… Real-world Rust implementations of design patterns  
âœ… Code snippets with detailed comments  
âœ… Experiments with `Rc<RefCell<T>>`, smart pointers, and ownership  
âœ… Test-driven examples for reliability  

## ðŸ›  Patterns Covered  
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Command



## ðŸ“Œ Why This Repo?
