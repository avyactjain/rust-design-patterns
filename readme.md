# Rust Design Patterns Playground 🚀  

A collection of Rust design pattern implementations as I learn and explore best practices in Rust. This repository includes examples of **creational, structural, and behavioral** patterns, with explanations and code samples.  

## 📂 What's Inside?  
✅ Real-world Rust implementations of design patterns  
✅ Code snippets with detailed comments  
✅ Experiments with `Rc<RefCell<T>>`, smart pointers, and ownership  
✅ Test-driven examples for reliability  

## 🛠 Patterns Covered  
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Command



## 📌 Why This Repo?
